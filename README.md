### Project Scope and Background
In the United States, many factors affect income per capita in counties which are political subdivisions used in many states. Some states such as Louisiana and Alaska do not have counties, but they have functional equivalents.

### Project Goals
 - To show which professions are vital in determining income per capita based on county in the United States
 - Assess salary as it relates to these factors
- Examine the effect of poverty on income per capita
- Predict the salary of someone in the United States as the rate of these profession changes
- Predict which jobs we should grow to increase income per capita in a county

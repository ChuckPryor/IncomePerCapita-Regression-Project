### Project Scope and Background
In the United States, many factors affect income per capita in counties which are political subdivisions used in many states. Some states such as Louisiana and Alaska do not have counties, but they have functional equivalents. In order to explore the relationship between various factors and income per capita, a regression model was developed. It's important to explore this relationship because higher income per capita in a county leads to a higher quality of life for a county's population as long as factors that negatively influence purchasing power such as inflation and goods & service prices are only marginally changing year after year. 

### Project Goals
 - To show which professions are vital in determining income per capita based on county in the United States
 - Assess salary as it relates to these factors
- Examine the effect of poverty on income per capita
- Predict the salary of someone in the United States as the rate of these profession changes
- Predict which jobs we should grow to increase income per capita in a county


### Data
acs2017_census_tract_data.csv 

The data was collected by the US Census Bureau and is publically available to use. It includes variables that potentially relate to income per capita in counties or functional equivalents in the United States. 


### Methodology

A regression model was developed to primarily explore the relationships between the independent variables of poverty rate, production, office, service, construction and professional jobs and the dependent variable income per capita based on a county in the United States.
The assumptions of regression modeling were checked prior to model development and included development of Pearson's R correlation heatmap, residual plots, exploration of variance inflation factors, Box-Cox transformation to assist with normalizing the relationship beween the dependent and independent variables. Prior to this, null values, duplicate values and outliers were purged from the dataset.
